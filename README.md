# StrengthTracker

This is a protoype for my Software Design and Evolution final project.
Strength Tracker is an iOS Mobile App focused on weightlifting.
The goal of the application is to keep track of the weightlifting workouts and overall workload during strength cycle. 

The prototype focuses on the integration of the mobile app with the Health Kit framework, which provides access to user health data recorded by phone and Apple Watch. 
The framework was implemented to request access to read active calories and exercise time in order to provide the user with a visual representation of workouts performed in the past week.
